# Customer Churn Prediction Using Naive Bayes

This project predicts telecom customer churn using the Telco Customer Churn dataset and a Naive Bayes classification model.

## 🔍 Overview

Customer churn is a critical business metric for telecom companies. This model helps predict whether a customer is likely to leave the service based on demographics and service usage patterns.

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle - Telco Customer Churn Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)
- **Features**: Demographics, billing, services
- **Target**: `Churn` (Yes/No)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: pandas, scikit-learn  
- **IDE**: Spyder (Anaconda)

## ✅ Key Features

- Data cleaning and missing value handling
- Label encoding for categorical variables
- Gaussian Naive Bayes model for classification
